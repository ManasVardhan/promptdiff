# Roadmap — promptdiff

## v0.2 (Planned)

### 🪝 Git Hooks Integration
Pre-commit and pre-push hooks that automatically track prompt changes alongside code, ensuring prompt versions are never lost.

### 🤖 CI/CD GitHub Action
A GitHub Action that runs `promptdiff` on pull requests, posting a summary of prompt changes as a PR comment for easy review.

### 🧠 Semantic Similarity with Embeddings
Go beyond text diffs — use embeddings to score semantic similarity between prompt versions and flag meaningful behavioral changes.

### 📂 Prompt Registry
Local or remote prompt registry to store, version, and retrieve prompt templates by name and tag across projects.
